# AUTO-HOURS
This was made in collaboration of Iheb, Percy, updated by Henom and myself. This is meant to be a stamina packing afk chceker after the rate limit update. An EXE and .py file will be linked here. If you don't want to install python or have issues running the hour counter, use the EXE. The source code (py) file is there to prove that there are no loggers inside the code, and that you may check the code yourself. 

# How to Use
Once you download the EXE or .py file, you will open the hour counter, input your token when prompted. Go into your hours channel and type "start". This will update your hours every hour until 80 hours.

# How to Run Using .Py File

just letting you know.... if you think the exe is a logger, just use the python file, it makes no difference to me at all
